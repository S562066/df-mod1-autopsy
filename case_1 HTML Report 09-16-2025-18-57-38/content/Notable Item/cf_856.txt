Defendant Sentenced to 13 Years in Federal Prison for $400 Million Payphone Investment Fraud
On February 23, 2006, in Atlanta, GA, Charles E. Edwards was sentenced to 13 years in prison to be followed by 3 years of supervised release, and was ordered to pay $320,397,837 in restitution following his September conviction on charges of wire fraud, money laundering, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.  The evidence showed that from 1996 through September 2000, Edwards, the founder of ETS Payphones, Inc. (ETS), raised capital to grow his coin-operated payphone business by using a network of independent insurance agents to sell payphones to investors throughout the United States for $5,000 to $7,000 per phone.  Edwards convinced investors to buy payphones and lease them back to ETS for what Edwards claimed would be a recession-proof, guaranteed profit of approximately 14 percent per year.  Edwards promised he would buy back their phones upon request, when, in fact, the company did not have the financial ability to do so.  The scheme defrauded approximately 12,000 nationwide investors out of more than $400 million.  The evidence also showed that in July 2000, just two months before ETS filed bankruptcy; Edwards personally assured investors that ETS was financially sound and had made a profit of nearly $8,700,000 the previous year.  In truth, ETS was never profitable and always needed to obtain money from new investors to make the monthly lease payments to existing investors.  Edwards siphoned off approximately $21 million of the fraud proceeds for himself and his wife, also using a significant portion of the fraud proceeds to promote the scheme to defraud by paying commissions to the many sales agents who sold the payphones to the victims, and by attempting to create an aura of legitimacy for himself and for his company by the use of private jets, luxury automobiles, and beach-front homes at Sea Island and St. Simons Island, Georgia.  In addition, the evidence showed that Edwards engaged in a series of unusual and convoluted financial transactions, which served no legitimate business purpose and were intended solely to conceal and disguise the source, location, ownership, nature, and control of the proceeds involved in those transactions.

The State Pension System Fund ultimately lost $4.724 million on the eChapman investments by Bond, while the Banker’s Trust Company pension lost another $700,000. Prosecutors further charged that Chapman stole from his companies by fraudulently obtaining checks for “business development” purposes that he then converted to cash and applied to his personal use.

Westerville Man Sentenced for Tax Crimes - Ordered to Pay more than $1.5 Million in Outstanding Taxes
On October 29, 2004, in Columbus, OH, Eugene Everett Armold was sentenced to 45 months in prison for making false statements on income tax returns and failing to report more than $4 million in adjusted gross income for 1999 and 2000. Armold was also ordered to pay outstanding income tax liability to the Internal Revenue Service in the form of restitution of $1,564,215.  At the trial, it was revealed that the $4,000,000 of unreported income came from Armold's operation and ownership of Purchase Plus Buyer's Group. He paid himself a consulting fee by transferring the money to a Nevada corporation known as Simba Financial Inc. This corporation had no business of its own or employees. It simply existed to receive this $4,000,000 and then funnel it to several other shell corporations until Armold either used the money for his personal use or sent it ($3,000,000) to an account overseas.  Armold subsequently brought the money back into the country through one of his attorney's escrow accounts and used it to finance other businesses.  The jury found that Armold filed an amended income tax return on June 8, 2001, claiming that his adjusted gross income for 1999 was $450,932, when in fact his true income for the year was at least $2,400,000. The jury also convicted him on a second count which stated that, on October 17, 2001, Armold filed an income tax return for the calendar year 2000 reporting an adjusted gross income of $1,143,520 when he knew his adjusted gross income for the year was at least $3,200,000.

151 Month Sentence Received
On July 20, 2004 in Akron, OH, Gary Harris was sentenced to 151 months imprisonment, to be followed by 3 years supervised release, and a $95,000 fine.  At trial, the evidence proved the defendants used a maze of trusts and corporations to try to hide approximately $18 million in income generated by various businesses they controlled, including historic Conneaut Lake Park in Crawford County, Pennsylvania.   Between January 1, 1994, and July 8, 2003, they paid little or no taxes on the income earned.

Bellingham Corporations Sentenced for Tax Fraud; Agree to Pay $36.5 Million in Back Taxes, Interest, Penalties and Fines
On June 25, 2004, in Seattle, WA, two Bellingham corporations, Alpha Technologies, Inc., (ATI) and G.B. Enterprises, Inc. (GBE), were sentenced for tax fraud offenses.  Both corporations had pleaded guilty on April 13, 2004.  According to the plea agreement, GBE agreed to pay $36.5 million in back taxes, interest, and penalties and fines to the IRS.  In addition, ATI and GBE each were fined $500,000 per corporation.  GBE was placed on three years of probation and ATI was placed on one year of probation with special conditions aimed at ensuring that neither corporation commit further tax fraud.  According to court records, GBE filed a fraudulent corporate income tax return for the calendar year 1996, and ATI aided and assisted in the preparation and presentation of this fraudulent return.  For 1996, GBE reported on its federal tax return sales commissions of $9,577,418.  In truth, $5,031,490 was improperly included in the claimed deduction.  This failure to accurately report only the legitimate business expense relating to commission results in an additional tax due and owing for 1996 of $1,721,869.  For the eight year period beginning in 1994 and continuing through 2001, GBE exaggerated its true sales commissions by $56,879,852, thereby resulting in an additional tax liability in excess of $19,564,000, exclusive of civil penalties and interest. 

President of Construction Company Sentenced
On June 24, 2004, in Billings, Montana, Ron Omo, president of Big O Construction, Inc., was sentenced to 2 years probation and ordered to pay restitution of $21,224.  In addition, Omo was fined $10,000 and the Big O Corporation was fined $40,000.  Omo pleaded guilty on February 5, 2004, to charges of disclosing false information on IRS Form 1096, Annual Summary of Information Returns, by not including IRS Form 1099, Miscellaneous Income, evidencing income received by persons driving vehicles for the benefit of Omo and Big O Construction. 

Omo established a payment system for 36 truck drivers employed by Big O Construction, whereby the drivers submitted "driving slips" to bill for driving services and other miscellaneous work provided to the company.  Omo and Big O Construction paid the drivers based upon the driving slips instead of time cards.  Under this system, no benefits, unemployment insurance or other employment taxes were paid in connection with the driving slip payments.  No year end summaries "Form 1099's" were issued to the 36 drivers with respect to the work accounted for by "driving slips."  By not issuing year end summaries, Omo and Big O Construction assisted the drivers in their non-reporting of income when the drivers filed their individual tax returns.  The practice of paying drivers through the use of drivers slips, failing to report the payments to the IRS, and the drivers failing to include the payments on their individual income tax returns, resulted in an aggregate federal income tax loss totaling $21,224.

The scheme created the appearance that his income was from a Virgin Islands source or effectively connected to a Virgin Islands business and thus eligible for the Tax Credit.    As a result of the scheme, Payne filed his 2000 and 2001 income tax returns with the Virgin Islands Bureau of Internal Revenue claiming falsely to be a Virgin Islands resident and claiming Tax Credits of $171,364 and $179,488, respectively.
